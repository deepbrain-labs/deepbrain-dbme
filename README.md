# deepbrain-dbme
A differentiable long-term memory system inspired by the hippocampus. 

Implement DBME as an online episodic writer + periodic consolidator + long-term KStore, integrated with an LM via a learned router and fusion module; provide reproducible experiments that show improved long-term recall, consolidation benefits, and controlled forgetting.
